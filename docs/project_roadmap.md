## Project Roadmap 

To support further development - throughout project 2 and beyond - we have compiled opportunities for expansion. 

### Overview of Expansion 

Expansion opportunities fall into one of three categories: 
- gesture recognition to improve hands-off capabilities 
- video conferencing features to improve user experience 
- deployment and increased user access to launch the software on a server to allow users from different networks to connect to improve functionality

These areas for expansion have been broken down further into feature issues and are listed in our [development project board](https://github.com/users/SiddarthR56/projects/1). Tasks belonging to each one of these areas are tagged for easy recognition. 

### Development Timeline 

We have developed three steps to complete all of the expansion opportunities: 

| Task | Milestone | Potential Date | Rationale | 
|------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Develop additional gestures | Milestone 1 | 1 months out | Begin by training the model with additional gestures. This allows easy integration with the to-be-developed features within the software | 
| Add Virtual Background Option | Milestone 2 | 2 months out | Use of the mediapipe library can be used for image segmentation and addition of virtual background | 
| Improve user experience | Milestone 3 | 3 months out | Ensure that all needed functionality are included. Potential ideas include messages, gifs, document sending, host controls, etc. This functionality needs to be implemented to have something to tie the gestures to. | 
| Tie gestures to actions | Milestone 4 | 4 months out | Tie gestures into software so that a gesture causes an action. This merges the work from milestone 1 & 2 | 
| Deploy software on sever for small scale / personal use | Milestone 5 | 6 months out |  To develop wide spread use capabilities, the software must be working on a server where users on different machines can interact. | 
| Deploy software on sever for widespread use | Milestone 6 | 12 months out | Expand functionality from Milestone 4 to include multiple users, different simultaneous calls and user accounts for tracking activity | 

*Note: the estimated timeline is for a single hobbyist developing this software, for an established team software development could be heavily accelerated. It is anticipated that Project 2 should complete Milestone 1-3*
