## Project Roadmap 

To support further development - throughout project 2 and beyond - we have compiled opportunities for expansion. 

### Overview of Expansion 

Expansion opportunities fall into one of three categories: 
- gesture recognition to improve hands-off capabilities 
- video conferencing features to improve user experience 
- deployment and increased user access to launch the software on a server to allow users from different networks to connect to improve functionality

These areas for expansion have been broken down further into feature issues and are listed in our [development project board](https://github.com/users/SiddarthR56/projects/1). Tasks belonging to each one of these areas are tagged for easy recognition. 

### Development Timeline 

Possible Future Features: 

| Task | Milestone | Estimated Time to Complete | Rationale | 
|------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Develop additional gestures | Milestone 1 | 10 Days | Begin by training the model with additional gestures. This allows easy integration with the to-be-developed features within the software | 
| Add Virtual Background Option | Milestone 2 | 10 Days | Use of the mediapipe library can be used for image segmentation and addition of virtual background | 
| Add Transcripts to the call  | Milestone 3 | 1 Week | Using speech recognition library live transcripts can be displayed during the call | 
| Add Broadcasting Option | Milestone 4 | 10 Days | Add call-flow option to boradcast video/audio | 
| Improve user experience | Milestone 5 | 1 Week | Ensure that all needed functionality are included. Potential ideas include messages, gifs, document sending, host controls, etc. This functionality needs to be implemented to have something to tie the gestures to | 
| Add User login page | Milestone 6 | 3 weeks | Add landing page for user to create an account and login, store credentials, etc | 

*Note: the estimated timeline is for a single hobbyist developing this software, for an established team software development could be heavily accelerated. It is anticipated that Project 2 should complete Milestone 1-3*
